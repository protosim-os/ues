***
- im thinking the universe will be a grid of multiple cells, each representing a region of the larger universe.

- the cells will have individual attributes such as location (x, y), temperature, density, matter, expansion rate, and 
    matter distribution.

- expansion rate: this will affect the probability of a new cell being generated on one of its edges ** 

- in the beginning will be a single cell with high values, of which more will be generated. this will
    initially be very qucik, but slow down rapidly over time, before shrinking in on itself
