# Universal Evolution Simulator (UES) README

## Overview

The Universal Evolution Simulator (UES) aims to create a detailed and accurate simulation of the universe's evolution, from the Big Bang to the potential end of the universe. This simulation will encompass three main components:
1. **Evolution of the System**: Simulating planetary and stellar events, including the formation of stars, planets, and eventual cosmic events like supernovae and black holes. Time is infinite, allowing for cycles of big bangs and eventual universal collapse.
2. **Evolution of Life**: Life emerges on planets based on probabilistic events. Lifeforms evolve through natural selection, with a chance for intelligent and super-intelligent life to develop, leading to complex behaviors and civilizations.
3. **Evolution of Economy and Technology**: Focuses on intelligent civilizations, simulating the rise of countries, economies, wars, technological advancements, and other societal developments.

Everything in the simulation is predetermined based on a seed, providing a consistent and reproducible universe each time the simulation is run.

## Interactions

### 1. System Evolution (Cosmic Events)
- **Big Bang and Initial Expansion**: Generate the universe's initial conditions, including the distribution of matter and energy.
- **Stellar Formation**: Simulate the formation of stars and planets from cosmic dust and gas.
- **Planetary Development**: Model the geological and atmospheric conditions on planets.
- **Cosmic Events**: Include supernovae, black holes, and other significant astronomical events.

### 2. Life Evolution
- **Abiogenesis**: Probabilistic emergence of life on suitable planets.
- **Biological Evolution**: Simulate natural selection, adaptation, and speciation.
- **Intelligent Life**: Small probability for the emergence of intelligent species, leading to complex societal structures.

### 3. Economic and Technological Evolution (Intelligent Life)
- **Civilization Formation**: Development of societies, countries, and cultures.
- **Economic Systems**: Simulate trade, resource management, and economic growth.
- **Technological Advancements**: Track technological progress, scientific discoveries, and industrialization.
- **Wars and Diplomacy**: Model conflicts, alliances, and diplomatic relations.
